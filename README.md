****************************************************************************
Whoaa there is a lot of files!!! 
Don't be afraid. We're here to guide you building your Aim-bot. Here are some informations you will need to get started.
****************************************************************************

First, you have to be aware of the need to make some 3D printing, and some laser cutting. Annnnnd for the latest version even some drilling and gluing! If you are not equipped for it, we will refer you to www.google.com, a great website where you can find many many people willing to help you make your parts for some $$$$.

*****************************************************************************
What you will use in this repository: everything, but here's how.
*****************************************************************************

 - First, there is a .PDF file to show you what the robot will look like once built. The name of this file is master_assembly.pdf. You may want to open it with Adobe acrobat reader DC because the 3D pdf seems to cause problems directly on the internet browser. In mine it does...
 
 - The BoM.xls file give a good feel of how much parts there is. It also shows you how we built the homemade (3D printed or laser cut)      parts, the material and the quatity of each. For the parts that are to buy (motors, OpenCR card, RPI, and also some standard ones),        the link of a website to buy them is given. You should know that there are plenty of other sites to buy it and this is only suggestions.

 - To facilitate your life, two folders "fab/dxf" and "fab/stl" are given with the parts exported from solidworks in extensions used for 3D printing (stl) and laser cutting (dxf).
 
 - When its time for assembling, some plans may be nice. We got exploded views of each assembly, leading to the complete build.
 those are the files named " master_assembly.pdf" and  "launcher_assembly.pdf"
 
*****************************************************************************
For modification / amelioration of the model
*****************************************************************************

 - The master_assembly.SLDASM file links every solidworks files, you may use it for modification of the original design.

 - The solidworks version used to draw the robot is 2018, you will have problem opening the parts if you want to modify them with an older version.
